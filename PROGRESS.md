# Development Progress

## Completed âœ…

### Initial Setup and Research
- [x] Explore available resources (docs, samples) to understand Nostr and Zig patterns
- [x] Create DEVELOPMENT.md with project overview and resources
- [x] Create PROGRESS.md with detailed todo list
- [x] Find canonical Nostr event examples

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ…
- [x] Design basic NostrEvent struct with proper Zig types
- [x] Create project file structure (src/nostr/, test/)
- [x] Set up basic build.zig configuration for testing
- [x] Create JSON test fixtures from canonical examples

### Phase 2: Basic Event Types (TDD) âœ…
- [x] Write test for Kind 1 (text note) parsing
- [x] Implement basic Event struct and JSON parsing
- [x] Write test for Kind 1 serialization (round-trip)
- [x] Implement JSON serialization for Event struct
- [x] Write test for Kind 0 (metadata) parsing
- [x] Implement metadata-specific content parsing
- [x] Write test for Kind 0 serialization

### Phase 3: Validation and Error Handling âœ…
- [x] Add proper error handling for malformed JSON
- [x] Implement custom error types (MissingField, InvalidFieldType, etc.)
- [x] Add graceful error messages instead of panics
- [x] Add basic validation checks (hex string length validation)

### Phase 5: CLI Interface âœ…
- [x] Create main.zig CLI entry point
- [x] Add JSON input/output via stdin/stdout
- [x] Add pretty-printing for events
- [x] Display parsed event details with descriptive labels
- [x] Show validation status in output

### Phase 4: Cryptographic Validation
- [ ] Add event ID validation (SHA256 verification)
- [ ] Add signature verification (BIP340/Schnorr)
- [ ] Add timestamp validation
- [ ] Add pubkey format validation (hex and length)
- [ ] Add comprehensive crypto tests

### Phase 6: Extended Event Types
- [ ] Implement Kind 3 (contact list) support
- [ ] Implement Kind 5 (deletion) support  
- [ ] Implement Kind 7 (reaction) support
- [ ] Add replaceable event logic
- [ ] Add event relationship tracking (replies, mentions)

### Phase 7: Cryptographic Operations
- [ ] Implement event signing
- [ ] Implement key pair generation
- [ ] Add event ID generation from content
- [ ] Add NIP-19 key encoding/decoding (npub, nsec)

### Phase 8: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement NIP-44 encrypted content support
- [ ] Add event filter matching (REQ filters)
- [ ] Add batch processing support in CLI
- [ ] Add relay message format support

### Phase 9: Performance and Polish
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Optimize memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Add streaming JSON parser for large events
- [ ] Profile and optimize hot paths

### Phase 10: Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples for each event kind
- [ ] Add integration tests with real relay data
- [ ] Create developer guide for library users

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Event struct creation and field access
- [ ] JSON parsing for each event kind
- [ ] JSON serialization for each event kind
- [ ] Error handling for malformed JSON
- [ ] Cryptographic operations

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Round-trip JSON parsing (parse â†’ serialize â†’ parse)
- [ ] Event validation end-to-end
- [ ] CLI interface testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Test Fixtures
- [ ] Kind 0 metadata events (various profiles)
- [ ] Kind 1 text note events (simple and complex)
- [ ] Kind 3 contact list events
- [ ] Kind 5 deletion events
- [ ] Kind 7 reaction events
- [ ] Invalid/malformed events for error testing

## Architecture Decisions

### Event Representation
- Use tagged union for event kinds to ensure type safety
- Store JSON content as parsed structs for metadata events
- Use `[]const u8` for hex-encoded fields (id, pubkey, sig)
- Use `i64` for timestamps (Unix seconds)

### Memory Management
- Use arena allocator for parsing operations
- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Provide both owned and borrowed string variants

### Error Handling
- Define comprehensive error types for each validation step
- Use Zig's error union pattern throughout
- Provide detailed error messages for debugging

### Testing Approach
- TDD: Write tests first, implement to make them pass
- Use real Nostr event examples as test fixtures
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include performance benchmarks
