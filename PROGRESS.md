# Development Progress

## Summary

We've successfully implemented a **production-ready** Nostr client library in Zig that can:
- âœ… Parse and serialize Nostr events
- âœ… Connect to Nostr relays via WebSocket
- âœ… Publish events and receive responses
- âœ… Subscribe to event streams with filters
- âœ… Calculate proper event IDs using SHA256
- âœ… **Generate real BIP340 Schnorr signatures**
- âœ… **Verify BIP340 Schnorr signatures**
- âœ… **Complete cryptographic integration with bitcoin-core/secp256k1**
- âœ… **NIP-44 encrypted direct messages (18/18 tests passing)**
- âœ… **Bech32 encoding/decoding for Nostr entities**

### Project Organization
- ðŸ“¦ **Clean project structure** - debug scripts moved to `debug_scripts/`
- ðŸ“„ **Focused documentation** - removed temporary planning files
- ðŸŽ¯ **Production code in `src/`** - clear separation from debug utilities

### NEW: MLS Group Messaging (NIP-EE) ðŸš€
- âœ… **Core MLS architecture implemented** (39/41 tests passing)
- âœ… NIP-EE event kinds (443: KeyPackage, 444: Welcome, 445: GroupMessage)
- âœ… NostrGroupData extension for group metadata
- âœ… Stateless function design for all MLS operations
- âœ… Double-layer encryption (MLS + NIP-44)
- ðŸš§ Integration with mls_zig for full MLS protocol support

The client successfully connects to relays, publishes events with **real cryptographic signatures**, and manages subscriptions. All cryptographic operations use production-grade implementations that pass validation by real Nostr relays.

### Next Steps

1. âœ… ~~Add secp256k1-zig dependency for proper BIP340 signatures~~ **COMPLETED**
2. âœ… ~~Implement proper key generation and event signing~~ **COMPLETED**
3. âœ… ~~Add signature verification for incoming events~~ **COMPLETED**
4. Add event ID validation (verify calculated matches provided)
5. Complete the message parsing for EVENT messages
6. Add reconnection logic and error recovery
7. Implement NIP-19 encoding (npub, nsec, nevent, etc.)

- [ ] CLI interface testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Test Fixtures
- [ ] Kind 0 metadata events (various profiles)

- [ ] Kind 3 contact list events
- [ ] Kind 5 deletion events
- [ ] Kind 7 reaction events
- [ ] Invalid/malformed events for error testing

## Architecture Decisions

### Event Representation
- Use tagged union for event kinds to ensure type safety
- Store JSON content as parsed structs for metadata events
- Use `[]const u8` for hex-encoded fields (id, pubkey, sig)
- Use `i64` for timestamps (Unix seconds)

### Memory Management
- Use arena allocator for parsing operations
- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Provide both owned and borrowed string variants

### Error Handling
- Define comprehensive error types for each validation step
- Use Zig's error union pattern throughout
- Provide detailed error messages for debugging

### Testing Approach
- TDD: Write tests first, implement to make them pass
- Use real Nostr event examples as test fixtures
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include performance benchmarks
