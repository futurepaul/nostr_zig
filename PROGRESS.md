# Development Progress

## Summary

We've successfully implemented a working Nostr client library in Zig that can:
- ‚úÖ Parse and serialize Nostr events
- ‚úÖ Connect to Nostr relays via WebSocket
- ‚úÖ Publish events and receive responses
- ‚úÖ Subscribe to event streams with filters
- ‚úÖ Calculate proper event IDs using SHA256
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Generate signatures (placeholder - needs BIP340 Schnorr)

The client successfully connects to relays, publishes events, and manages subscriptions. Event signatures are currently placeholders since Zig's standard library provides ECDSA but not the Schnorr signatures that Nostr requires.

### Next Steps

1. Add secp256k1-zig dependency for proper BIP340 signatures
2. Implement proper key generation and event signing
3. Add signature verification for incoming events
4. Complete the message parsing for EVENT messages
5. Add reconnection logic and error recovery
6. Implement NIP-19 encoding (npub, nsec, nevent, etc.)

- [ ] Add batch processing support in CLI
- [ ] Add relay message format support

### Phase 9: Performance and Polish

- [ ] Add streaming JSON parser for large events
- [ ] Profile and optimize hot paths

### Phase 10: Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples for each event kind

- [ ] Create developer guide for library users

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Event struct creation and field access
- [ ] JSON parsing for each event kind
- [ ] JSON serialization for each event kind
- [ ] Error handling for malformed JSON
- [ ] Cryptographic operations

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Round-trip JSON parsing (parse ‚Üí serialize ‚Üí parse)
- [ ] Event validation end-to-end
- [ ] CLI interface testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Test Fixtures
- [ ] Kind 0 metadata events (various profiles)
- [ ] Kind 1 text note events (simple and complex)
- [ ] Kind 3 contact list events
- [ ] Kind 5 deletion events
- [ ] Kind 7 reaction events
- [ ] Invalid/malformed events for error testing

## Architecture Decisions

### Event Representation
- Use tagged union for event kinds to ensure type safety
- Store JSON content as parsed structs for metadata events
- Use `[]const u8` for hex-encoded fields (id, pubkey, sig)
- Use `i64` for timestamps (Unix seconds)

### Memory Management
- Use arena allocator for parsing operations
- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Provide both owned and borrowed string variants

### Error Handling
- Define comprehensive error types for each validation step
- Use Zig's error union pattern throughout
- Provide detailed error messages for debugging

### Testing Approach
- TDD: Write tests first, implement to make them pass
- Use real Nostr event examples as test fixtures
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include performance benchmarks
