## 🎉 **Issues Fixed This Session**

### 1. **HMAC Verification** (✅ FIXED!)

**Root Cause:** The HMAC was being calculated over incorrect data. The NIP-44 spec requires HMAC over `nonce + ciphertext` only, but we were including the version byte.

**Fix Applied:**
```zig
// Correct HMAC calculation (matching Go/Rust/C implementations)
var hmac_ctx = crypto.auth.hmac.Hmac(crypto.hash.sha2.Sha256).init(&message_keys.hmac_key);
hmac_ctx.update(nonce);      // 32 bytes of nonce
hmac_ctx.update(encrypted);   // ciphertext only
```

**Also Fixed:** The test runner was incorrectly passing `sec2` directly instead of deriving the public key from it.

### 2. **Bech32 Test Failure** (✅ FIXED!)

**Root Cause:** The bech32 encoding was using `segwit_addr_encode` which adds a witness version byte, making the decoded data 33 bytes instead of 32.

**Fix Applied:** Changed to use plain `bech32_encode` with proper 8-bit to 5-bit conversion:
```zig
// Convert 8-bit bytes to 5-bit values before encoding
const result = c.bech32_encode(&output, hrp_c.ptr, data_5bit[0..data_5bit_len].ptr, data_5bit_len, c.BECH32_ENCODING_BECH32);
```

## 🏆 **Completed Successfully**

### Major Breakthrough - ECDH Fix!
- ✅ **Fixed ECDH shared secret generation** - The issue was that `secp256k1_ecdh` by default applies SHA256 to the shared point, but NIP-44 requires the raw x-coordinate
- ✅ **Implemented custom ECDH hash function** - `nip44EcdhHashFunction` that returns x-coordinate directly without hashing
- ✅ **Fixed x-only public key handling** - Always use even y-coordinate (0x02) when converting from x-only to compressed format, as per Nostr/NIP-44 convention
- ✅ **Conversation keys now match test vectors perfectly!**
  - sec1+pub1: `3b4610cb7189beb9cc29eb3716ecc6102f1247e8f3101a03a1787d8908aeb54e` ✅
  - sec1+pub2: `c41c775356fd92eadc63ff5a0dc1da211b268cbea22316767095b2871ea1412d` ✅

### Previously Fixed Issues:
- ✅ **HKDF implementation** - Using paulmillr test vectors, HKDF now works perfectly
- ✅ **Padding algorithm** - Fixed to match exact Rust reference implementation (129→160, not 192)
- ✅ Module structure (`src/nip44/`)
- ✅ Test vector integration with official JSON
- ✅ Real ChaCha20IETF integration
- ✅ Base64 encoding/decoding
- ✅ HMAC-SHA256 authentication
- ✅ Main encrypt/decrypt API structure
- ✅ JSON test vector runner
- ✅ 15/17 tests passing (up from 13/17!)

## 📚 **Technical Notes**

### Key Fix - Custom ECDH Hash Function
```zig
fn nip44EcdhHashFunction(
    output: [*c]u8,
    x32: [*c]const u8,
    y32: [*c]const u8,
    data: ?*anyopaque,
) callconv(.C) c_int {
    _ = y32; // y-coordinate is not used in NIP-44
    _ = data; // no additional data needed
    
    // Copy x-coordinate directly to output
    @memcpy(output[0..32], x32[0..32]);
    
    return 32; // Return number of bytes written
}
```

### X-Only Public Key Convention
- NIP-44/Nostr always treats x-only public keys as having even y-coordinate
- When converting 32-byte x-only to 33-byte compressed: always prefix with 0x02
- Reference: Go implementation `hex.DecodeString("02" + pub2)`
- Reference: Rust implementation `PublicKey::from_x_only_public_key(x_only_public_key_b, Parity::Even)`

### HMAC Issue Resolution
The HMAC issue was caused by including the version byte in the HMAC calculation. The correct approach (verified against Go, Rust, and C implementations) is:
1. HMAC is calculated over `nonce + ciphertext` only
2. Version byte (first byte) is NOT included
3. HMAC bytes (last 32 bytes) are NOT included

### Test Environment
- Zig 0.14.1
- Test vectors from paulmillr/nip44
- Test command: `zig build test`

## 🔄 **Latest Session Updates (2025-01-11)**

### Major Fixes Applied:
1. **ECDH Custom Hash Function** - Implemented to return raw x-coordinate instead of SHA256 hash
2. **X-Only Public Key Handling** - Fixed to always use even y-coordinate (0x02)
3. **Test Vector Update** - Using paulmillr's comprehensive test suite
4. **HMAC Calculation** - Fixed to match spec: HMAC over nonce + ciphertext only
5. **Test Runner** - Fixed to derive public key from sec2 in test vectors

### Progress Summary:
- Started: 13/17 tests passing
- After ECDH fix: 15/17 tests passing
- **Current: 16/17 tests passing! 🎉**
- Fixed: HKDF, padding, ECDH shared secret generation, HMAC verification
- Remaining: Only unrelated bech32 test

### Key Insight on Test Vectors
The encrypt_decrypt test vectors provide `sec1` and `sec2` (both secret keys). The test runner must derive the public key from `sec2` before calling decrypt, matching how the reference implementations handle these test cases.
