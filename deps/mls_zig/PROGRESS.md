## Notes

- BinaryTree uses generic types for leaf and parent node data
- Iterators return typed structs (LeafItem/ParentItem) instead of anonymous structs
- Diff system uses HashMaps for tracking changes instead of BTreeMap
- Tree growing doubles leaf count, shrinking halves it (maintains full binary tree property)
- TLS codec follows MLS/TLS conventions (big-endian, length-prefixed data)
- VarBytes manages memory automatically for variable-length data
- HPKE encryption using zig-hpke library for path secret protection
- TreeSync wrapper provides high-level tree operations over BinaryTree
