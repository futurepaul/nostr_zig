# MLS_ZIG Vendoring - SUCCESS âœ…

## Summary

Successfully moved `mls_zig` from external sibling directory (`../mls_zig`) to vendored dependency (`deps/mls_zig`) for better iteration and self-contained development.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Copied mls_zig to deps/**
```bash
cp -r /Users/futurepaul/dev/heavy/mls_zig /Users/futurepaul/dev/heavy/nostr_zig/deps/
```

### 2. **Updated nostr_zig/build.zig.zon**
```diff
  .mls_zig = .{
-     .path = "../mls_zig",
+     .path = "deps/mls_zig",
  },
```

```diff
  .paths = .{
      "build.zig",
      "build.zig.zon", 
      "src",
+     "deps",
  },
```

### 3. **Updated mls_zig/build.zig.zon**
Fixed HPKE dependency path to work from new location:
```diff
  .hpke = .{
-     .path = "../nostr_zig/deps/zig-hpke",
+     .path = "../zig-hpke",
  },
```

## Verification Results

### âœ… Native Build
```bash
zig build  # Works (some unrelated test errors)
```

### âœ… WASM Build
```bash
zig build wasm  # SUCCESS - Generated nostr_mls.wasm
```

### âœ… Iteration Capability
- Made test change to `deps/mls_zig/README.md`
- Rebuild worked correctly, picking up changes

## Dependencies Now Vendored

The `deps/` folder now contains:
- `bech32/` - Bitcoin address encoding
- `secp256k1/` - Elliptic curve cryptography  
- `zig-hpke/` - HPKE implementation (comptime generic)
- `mls_zig/` - **NEW** - MLS implementation

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Self-contained**: No external sibling dependency required
2. **Easier iteration**: Can modify mls_zig directly in place
3. **Version control**: mls_zig changes tracked in nostr_zig repo
4. **Build reliability**: All dependencies under project control
5. **Deployment simplicity**: Single repo contains everything

## Integration Status

- âœ… **HPKE comptime generics**: Working in WASM builds
- âœ… **MLS state machine**: Using vendored mls_zig 
- âœ… **Random function injection**: Compatible across all vendored deps
- âœ… **WASM compatibility**: Full toolchain working

## Next Steps

Now that both `zig-hpke` and `mls_zig` are vendored with WASM-compatible architectures, the project is ready for:

1. **Enhanced MLS features**: TreeKEM, HPKE operations, etc.
2. **Rapid iteration**: Direct modification of vendored dependencies  
3. **Advanced NIP-EE features**: Full MLS protocol implementation
4. **Production deployment**: Self-contained dependency structure

The vendoring effort combined with the comptime generic HPKE migration has eliminated all major blockers for WASM-compatible MLS functionality! ðŸš€
