# KeyPackage Cleanup Summary

## Problem
We had two incompatible KeyPackage types:
1. `mls_zig.key_package_flat.KeyPackage` - Fixed-size arrays, WASM-friendly, no heap allocation
2. `types.KeyPackage` - Full MLS structure with LeafNode, uses heap allocation

This led to complex conversion code and hacks like the manual KeyPackage construction in `test_welcome_roundtrip.zig`.

## Solution
Created `createGroupFlat` function that accepts flat KeyPackages directly, eliminating the need for conversion.

### Changes Made

1. **Added `createGroupFlat` to `groups.zig`**:
   - Accepts `[]const mls_zig.key_package_flat.KeyPackage`
   - Extracts member info directly from flat KeyPackage
   - No conversion needed

2. **Added `createWelcomeForFlatMember` to `groups.zig`**:
   - Works with flat KeyPackages
   - Uses fixed arrays directly for HPKE encryption

3. **Updated `test_welcome_roundtrip.zig`**:
   - Uses `createGroupFlat` instead of `createGroup`
   - No more manual KeyPackage type construction
   - Much cleaner and simpler code

## Benefits

1. **No more conversion hacks** - Direct use of flat KeyPackages
2. **Better performance** - No unnecessary heap allocations
3. **Cleaner code** - Removed ~50 lines of boilerplate from the test
4. **WASM-friendly** - Maintains the benefits of fixed-size arrays

## Next Steps

1. Migrate all uses of `createGroup` to `createGroupFlat`
2. Remove `keypackage_converter.zig` entirely
3. Consider deprecating `types.KeyPackage` in favor of flat KeyPackages everywhere

## Testing

The `test_welcome_roundtrip.zig` test now compiles and runs without errors, demonstrating that the flat KeyPackage approach works correctly for the full MLS flow.
